 label "==================README==================\n\nWelcome to Nuke Simple Pipeline (NSP)! This package is ideal for compositors\nwho are used to a studio pipeline and are starting a personal or freelance project\nusing a vanilla Nuke. The goal of NSP is to automate common tasks in order to\nreduce manual labour and human error, without getting complicated.\n\nNSP accomplishes this with:\n\n-Ability to control \"Show\" and \"User\" environoment\n-Automatic Script creation with procedural paths and names\n-Automatic Read and Write naming and creation\n-Automatic versioning of writes to always match script version\n-Ability to create reads sourced from selected writes\n-As many relative paths as possible\n-Some handy python scripts\n\n\n=====Getting Started=====\n\n1. To making NSP work, create the \"NSP_Settings\" node inside Nuke.\n\nFill in the 3 options with your preferences:\n\n-Set \"Projects Directory\" to a path that exists in your system, ideally where\nyour projects are saved.\n\n-Set \"User\" and \"Show\" to one of the dropdown options, which\ncorresponds with the folders that exists inside the \"Users\" and \"Shows\"\ndirectories inside your .nuke/NSP folder respectively. If you don't want to\nuse them, these can be set to \[None].\n\nAfter setting these variables, save this file and restart Nuke for it to work.\nIf there is a settings conflict, user settings will overwrite show settings. For\nexample: If you set the default resolution to HD in your user settings, but\nthe show is set to 4K, Nuke will use HD.\n\n2. Time to save a script for your new project. In Nuke, create\n\"NSP_New_Script_Generator\". In the node's properties, choose the Show,\nSequence, Shot names, and version number you want this script to have. It is\nimportant that this naming pattern is maintained for other tools to work. Now click\nthe \"Calculate Script Name\" button to see your result in the \"Script Name\" field.\n\nIt should look something like:\n\n...//Show/Sequence/Shot/Nuke/Scripts/Show_Sequence_Shot_v001.nk\n\nor\n\n...//AZL/Seq1/0075/Nuke/Scripts/AZL_Seq1_0075_v001.nk\n\nWhere:\n\n'...//' is your projects directory\n'AZL' is the show name\n'Seq1' is the Sequence name\n'0075' is the Shot name\n'v001' is the script version\n\nIf the name looks correct,  click the \"Save Script\" button to create the path\nand save the script inside.\n\nNow onto writing and reading media in your new script.\n\n======= NSP_Precomp =======\n\nWhen NSP_Precomp is created in the nodegraph (ctrl + w), a popup menu\nwill appear asking for the Precomp Name and file extension. For the extension,\n\"exr\" is default, but you can change it to anything like \"png\" or \"mov\". After pressing\n\"Ok\" it will create the precomp write node with a relative path to your project directory.\nIn the node properties, there is a tab titled \"NSP\" where you can update the Precomp\nName and file extension. You must save the script to apply your changes.\n\nThe write path should look something like:\n\nSequence/Shot/Nuke/Renders/PrecompName/v001/Show_Seq_Shot_PrecompName_v001_%04d.exr\n\n===== Create Read Nodes from Writes =====\n\nAfter writing out files to disk with these tools, you can select a write node\nand press (ctrl + r) to create a read nodes sourced from the selected\nwrites. Reads created this way use relative paths.\n\n===== Saving and Versioning Up =====\n\nWhen you save or version up your script, NSP_Precomp nodes will automatically \nupdate to match the current script version. With this, v025 of a precomp\nwill always be from v025 of the script!\n\n===== DWAA Compression =====\n\nIf you want to use DWAA compression to save disk space, all write nodes\ncreated with NSP using the exr extension will always have the\ncompression method labelled. This also applies to all read nodes created\npointing to a file using DWAA compression. This is so you will always have\na reminder for if a file was created using DWAA since it can be almost\nimpossible to tell just by looking at the image. Usually you will want to\nswitch back to Zip (1 scanline) for your final renders to retain pixel accuracy.\n\n===== Some Useful Python Tools =====\n\n1. Relative Reads\n\nThis tool is automatic in NSP and does not require your input. Whenever\nand however you create a read node, NSP will search for the project path\ninside the read node's file path and delete it, forcing the path to become\nrelative. This only works if the media is coming from inside the project\nfolder. If from outisde the project folder, it will use an absolute path.\n\n2. Gizmos to Group\n\nThis tool turns selected gizmos in your script into groups. This can be\nextremely important if you are going to share your script with another\nartist who is using a different nuke setup since the gizmos you have\ninstalled will only work if they are installed on the other system as well.\nGroups on the other hand are saved inside the script itself, so can always\nbe opened.\n\nWhy not always use groups and never use gizmos? Because saving\neverything in the script can massively increase the size of the script file\nand make it much slower to read/save.\n\n==============================================\n\n===== A Note on \"Users\" and \"Shows\" =====\n\nThe Users and Shows folders inside .nuke/NSP are meant to be used as\nmodular addons. Lets say you are working on a project called AZL and\nyou always want the default resolution in Nuke to be 4096x2480 while\nyou are working on the show. You can set this option in the menu.py file\ninside the .nuke/NSP/Shows/AZL folder, and then set your Show variable\nwith the \"NSP_Settings\" node  to AZL. Nuke will now load the settings you\nspecify from the AZL show folder on startup.\n\nThis is the same for the .nuke/NSP/Users folder. If you want to use a\ncustom gizmo, python script, or set custom nuke behaviours, you can do\nit in your Users folder, which will allow you to have different profiles or\n\"Users\" you can pick between and share without copying your .nuke folder."
