to install the connect dot and get more functionality over the base dot:

-place the ConnectDot folder into your .nuke folder
-add this line to the init.py - "nuke.pluginAddPath('ConnectDot')"
-add this line to the menu.py - "import ConnectDot_Functions"

-this will make it so when you crete the connect dot using "," the node will automatically refresh and attempt to connect to a camera with a dot directly underneath it ("rendercam" dot for example)
-this will also let you "ctrl + ," to make a dot with a label easier by selecting the node you wish to make a dot under
